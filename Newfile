This is the first line for my file.

I am trying to create new checkpoints. For this line I will add new checkpoint.


ok, so i created 2 checkpoints... not sure i own this yet.
my main goal is to now update this file and keep on creating new checkpoints every time I add something new.

I can move on to branching once I am super comfortable doing this. 


again, part of practising this: this is my 4th checkpoint so I am adding this info to see if i can easily create a new checkpoint after this line.



ok!  I'm getting closer to doing this super eassily now.
this is my 5th insertion of new line for my 5th checkpoint.



:)

ok so this is checkpoint 6... btw, it was not case sensitive when i vi into this file



:-)


 7th, last try
